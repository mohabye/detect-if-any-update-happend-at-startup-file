The $StartupFolder variable is set to the default startup folder location in Windows, which is %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. This assumes that the user has not changed the default location of the startup folder.
The $LastWriteTime variable is set to the "LastWriteTime" property of the startup folder using the Get-Item cmdlet.
The $CurrentTime variable is set to the current date and time using the Get-Date cmdlet.
The script then compares the $LastWriteTime with the current time minus one minute (using the AddMinutes method), to see if the startup folder has been updated within the past minute.
If the startup folder has been updated recently, the script outputs a message saying that updates have been detected. Otherwise, it outputs a message saying that no updates have been detected.
